# DFCalc

https://dfcalc.antd.xyz

DFCalc is a calculator tool designed for the game [Delta Force](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html). Here you
can find various tools to compare the in-game weapons. The "Compare All" tool can be used to compare every gun in the
game across various stats from, damage per shot, shots to kill, and time to kill. The "Inspect One" tool can be used to
learn about all the stats that impact how much damage a gun provides.

Currently, all of the data used by calculations was recorded by me, antD, which means there likely will be mistakes. If
you find any problems with the data that don't match what you experience in-game, visit the
[issues](https://dfcalc.antd.xyz/issues) page to help correct it. If you'd like to help keep this tool up-to-date visit
the [contribute](https://dfcalc.antd.xyz/contribute) page to see how you can help. All of the raw data used by the
calculator can be found [here]("https://github.com/antD97/DFCalc/tree/main/public/data")</A>.
